# Rust API Template

This repository serves as a **template for building APIs in Rust**. It provides a solid foundation with recommended structure and configuration files to help you get started quickly and maintain consistency across projects.

## Getting Started

To use this template for your own API, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Your API Name

You must define the name of your API in the following files:

- `Cargo.toml` – Update the `[package]` name to match your API.
- `docker-compose.yml` and/or `Dockerfile` – Set the appropriate service/image name.
- `nginx.conf` – Adjust upstream and server blocks to reflect your API name.

This ensures correct identification and deployment of your API.

### 2. Document Your API

Don't forget to fill out the `API.md` file to describe your API's endpoints, authentication mechanisms, error handling, and any other relevant documentation. This is crucial for both development and future maintenance.
